runtime branch todo:
- make a helper function to construct list of params from a struct, to be used in example_script_runtime.
- runtime should validate the params, num_outputs, and num_temps.
- handle temp_floats properly
- delay buffer length is always 11025 at runtime (delay module itself needs to be refactored)
