Audio playback and synth in [Zig](https://www.ziglang.org/), and all around great guy.

## Examples
`zig build play` to launch an SDL window where you can play a simple synthesizer with the keyboard. Home row to play a C major scale, sharps/flats in the qwerty row. Hold space to play a low C in a separate voice.

`zig build song` to launch an SDL window playing a canned melody (first few bars of Bach's Toccata in D Minor).
